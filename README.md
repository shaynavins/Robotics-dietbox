# Robotics-dietbox
techfair 6th grade

This was a robot I built for the 2019 Fulton County Tech Fair(Georgia). The Diet-bot was programmed and built by me to protect and safeguard 
the most priced possessions of many chidren, candy. Built to open on password and color ticket detection, the robot ensures that the contents of the box are never 
opened. The shape and fixation of sensors is built to sense any new person trying to open the box, with an alarm and detection, the robot will back away, unless 
a ticket is shown, at which the bot swings open its container. Self moving, and highly intelligent, I present to you the very first Diet-bot.
